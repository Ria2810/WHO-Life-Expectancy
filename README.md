# WHO-Life-Expectancy
This project focuses on analyzing global health data obtained from the Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository under the World Health Organization (WHO) and economic data from the United Nations. The dataset encompasses information on life expectancy, health factors, and economic indicators for 193 countries over the period of 2000-2015.

## Overview:
The dataset is meticulously curated, merging multiple data sources to form a comprehensive dataset for analysis. Critical health factors that significantly impact life expectancy have been selected for further examination. The analysis aims to uncover insights into the relationships between various predictors and life expectancy.

## Dataset Characteristics:
The final merged dataset comprises 22 columns and 2938 rows, representing 193 countries and 20 predicting variables. These variables are categorized into Immunization-related factors, Mortality factors, Economical factors, and Social factors, providing a comprehensive view of the factors influencing life expectancy.

## Acknowledgements:
The data collection process was facilitated with the assistance of Deeksha Russell and Duan Wang, utilizing resources from the WHO and United Nations websites.

## Key Questions Addressed:
- Do the chosen predicting factors significantly affect life expectancy?
- Should countries with low life expectancy increase healthcare expenditure to improve lifespan?
- How do mortality rates impact life expectancy across different age groups?
- What is the correlation between lifestyle factors (e.g., diet, exercise, smoking) and life expectancy?
- What is the influence of education on human lifespan?
- Is there a relationship between alcohol consumption and life expectancy?
- Do densely populated countries tend to have lower life expectancy?
- How does immunization coverage impact life expectancy?

## Inspiration:
The project aims to provide valuable insights into global health trends, informing policymakers, researchers, and healthcare professionals about the factors influencing life expectancy worldwide. By addressing key questions, this analysis contributes to a deeper understanding of public health dynamics and potential interventions to improve global health outcomes.
